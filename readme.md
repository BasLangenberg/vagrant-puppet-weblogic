# Vagrant, Puppet and WebLogic

The purpose of this repository is to explain Puppet's role and profile pattern to a WebLogic savvy audience. It is intended to go with a introductionary talk about what Puppet is and how it can help us in the 'enterprise'.

Many thanks to Edwin Biemond and Bert Hajee for the orawls and easy_type modules, which are the core of this solution.
